RAINWATER HARVESTING PROJECT

Project Title: Decoding disasters created due to water resource mismanagement

The methodology involved several key steps. First, using machine learning, we imported various parameters from relevant libraries for implementation in the code. We then collected historical data of Bengaluru over several years, organized it in an Excel sheet, and saved it as a CSV file. This data was used to create different visualizations: a line graph for the year vs. rainfall, a scatter plot for the year vs. flood/drought events, a bar graph for the year vs. humidity, a bar graph for monthly rainfall in millimeters, and a combination of doughnut and line plots for the year vs. various groundwater data. Additionally, we developed a chatbot using natural language processing (NLP). This chatbot provides detailed information about specific parameters on request, showcasing data for any selected variable. Finally, leveraging deep learning, we trained and tested our groundwater data to forecast the groundwater replenishment levels by the end of the year 2032. This comprehensive approach integrates machine learning, NLP, and deep learning to analyze, visualize, and predict environmental trends and water management in Bengaluru.
